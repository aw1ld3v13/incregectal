    - set up server architecture X
    - Create: user w/ save data 
    - Read: check server for user data and change gamestate to match
    - Update: update user data (name, total gecs)
    - Delete: reset/wipe save data
  c) integration

3) reach/expand scope

    - frontend: clickable blocks, total trackers, passive generation adding to total, unlock @ certain total thresholds
    - backend: userdata keeps track of generators
  b) gec aesthetics - reference advanced css/html unit


CONSIDER:
- look at units for dependencies and structure help
- react hooks
- browserify?
- look at the innerhtml of existing games (a dark room, trimps, cookie clicker, etc)
- use webpack to minify images: compress/minify jpgs for quicker loadtime
